Participating
=================

Before you can be awarded anything under the TTS MPP you'll need to request a DUNS number and register on SAM.gov.

Request a DUNS number
---------------------

Start by [looking up your DUNS number](http://www.dnb.com/duns-number/lookup.html) on the Dun & Bradstreet website. If you've worked with the government in the past, you may already have one.

If you don't yet have a DUNS number, you can start by [creating a Dun & Bradstreet business profile](https://www.dandb.com/product/companyupdate/companyupdateHome?execution=e10s1). You will need to use a browser other than Google Chrome, as the Dun & Bradstreet website does not currently support it. Once you've created a business profile, your DUNS number (and marketing materials, see below) will be sent to the contact information you specify within 30 days after your profile is created.

Please be aware that "as a result of obtaining a DUNS number, you \[will\] be included on D&B's marketing list that is sold to other companies. If you do not want your name/entity included on this marketing list, you must contact D&B to request removal." ([source](https://fsd.gov/fsd-gov/answer.do?sysparm_kbid=4dd0e67e6f585100211956532e3ee43a&sysparm_search=duns)) Our team is really sorry about this. It's [an issue we're aware of](https://github.com/18F/micropurchase/issues/1090) and looking into.

Register on SAM.gov
-------------------

Once you have your DUNS number, [visit SAM.gov](https://www.sam.gov) and create an individual account. The process is demonstrated in the video, below. Note that while registration physically takes about an hour, it can actually take **about a day or two** for the your application to be processed and for your information to propagate across various systems.

Be sure to link your DUNS number with your SAM.gov profile.

Place a bid
-----------

To place a bid, simply find an open auction by visiting the TTS MPP repository and browsing the Issues. Once you've identified an auction on which you'd like to bid, follow the instructions regarding submitting your response and you're part of the program! Good luck and we look forward to working with you!
